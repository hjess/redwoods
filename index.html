    <h2>A Masters Swim Group in Mercer Island, Washington</h2>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p style="font-style:italic;font-size:93%;">
        We are the Mercer Island Redwoods, a group of adult swimmers affiliated with United States
        Masters Swimming (<a target="usms" href="http://www.usms.org">www.usms.org</a>) who take
        both our swimming and our fun seriously. We work out every weekday morning from 5:30 to
        7:00 at the Mercerwood Shore Club in a beautiful 25 meter outdoor pool covered by a
        well-lit and well-ventilated bubble during the six coldest and darkest months of the year.
        Workouts vary somewhat in intensity, but all feature a full-time coach on the deck and lots
        of friendly and encouraging faces in the pool. During the summer, we provide opportunities
        for group open water swims in Lake Washington. We emphasize fitness, conditioning, and
        community, but we have our competitive streak, too, and we're committed to supporting
        the swimming goals of all of our members, regardless of what they may be. People of
        all skill levels and all adult ages are always welcome to drop in and sample the experience
        or join the fun as a regular. We meet for coffee most Fridays after workout to celebrate
        the week's accomplishments, both in and out of the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our group has been together at the <a target="msc" href="http://www.mercerwood.com/">Mercerwood
        Shore Club</a> pool since the mid 90s, but dates back to the 80s, at least. The group currently
        includes swimmers in their early 20s, early 70s, and everywhere between.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Derek Young runs workouts 4 mornings a week, from 5:30-7:00am. He may follow a somewhat
            standard Masters pattern (distance/IM/sprint) through the week; or might surprise us with a
            new workout themes completely out of the blue; they're never exactly the same.
        </li>

        <li>
            In addition, one of our own swimmers takes the deck each Wednesday morning
            to run a workout; these are always <em>entertaining!</em>

            “Derek moved to Seattle in April of 2018. Immediately prior to moving, Derek served as the Head Coach of the Sandhills Sand Sharks in Southern Pines, North Carolina and started the Masters swim program in Southern Pines. Before that he spent three years with Nation’s Capital Swim Team (NCAP) and the Arlington Aquatic Club. During his eight years on deck he has worked with swimmers of all ages and achievement levels.
            <br><br>

            Derek’s swimming career started in the Northern Virginia Swim League (NVSL) when he was 6 years old with an ill-fated relay appearance for the Lincolnia Park Lazers. In
            addition to his local summer league team, Derek also swam for the Arlington Aquatic Club for 10 years. In 2000, Derek graduated with a degree in marketing from the
            University of Maryland. At Maryland he was a member of the varsity swim team and letter winner.”

Diving on a club team became my life in HS and competed thru 4 years of college. Then after 10 years in a land-locked state, I returned to the NW, found masters swimming, took to it like a fish to water and never looked back. I prefer lakes and oceans to the pool, since I’ve pretty much got one speed. Give me a long freestyle set and I’m a happy camper.  What will I give you?  Likely something with a pattern.</blockquote>

        <p>
            Although the group has been together for more than 15 years, the Mercer
            Island Redwoods formed as an official organization in June, 2010. Here are
            answers to several questions that arose as the group was getting started:<br><br>

                    You can choose to pay quarterly if you plan to swim full-time, by the

                    We're not planning to kick people off the team for serially quitting and
                    rejoining. That said, it's important to realize that there will be no long
                    term benefit to playing those sorts of games. For example, if all of our
                    members only paid for 11 months of MIR membership a year, we'd have to set
                    monthly rates at 109.1% of what they would be if everyone just paid for 12
                    months in order to pay our bills. Everyone ends up paying the exact same
                    annual total anyway, it just makes budgeting and planning harder. The best
                    way to keep rates low is for everyone to commit to being in it for the long
                    haul so that we can plan lower rates for everyone without having to worry
                    about contingency funds for when people periodically drop out for short
                    periods.

                    Who are the coaches?
                </span>

                <p style="display: none; font-weight: normal;">
                    We are currently honored to have Derek Young run 4 weekly workouts; on Wednesdays we
                    depend on one of several of our own members as a fill-in <em>guest coach</em>.
                    Currently, certified coaches include Tom Grandine, Mike Schaeffer, Alex Goldstein,
                    Tom Robertson, Adair Dingle, Q Glaze, Steve Sussex, Steve Underbrink,
                    and Shannon McIntyre. Read more about all of our coaches

                    Are guests welcome?
                </span>

                <p style="display: none; font-weight: normal;">
                    By all means, yes. Those of you who haven't committed to swim with us
                    regularly, but would nevertheless like to make appearances at our workouts
                    from time to time, are welcome to do so. Please feel free to swim with us
                    as often as you'd like. The drop-in fee for guest swimmers is $12; please
                    leave that with the coach on deck as you enter.

                    Is USMS registration required?
                </span>

                <p style="display: none; font-weight: normal;">
                    Yes! USMS provides local teams like ours with the liability insurance
                    coverage required by MSC, our host pool (as any other pool-renting facility
                    requires). The <em>certificate of liability insurance</em> is provided by
                    USMS free of charge, but only if all of our team members are also USMS
                    members in good standing. There are plenty of other benefits to USMS
                    membership; if you aren't already a member, you can register online
                    at <a href="http://www.usms.org/reg/" target="_blank">www.usms.org</a>.

                </span>

                <p style="display: none; font-weight: normal;">
                    Please arrange to pay for your membership at the beginning of each quarter.
                    Make your check payable to <em>Mercer Island Redwoods</em> and deliver
                    it to Tom Grandine or Mike Schaeffer at practice. Non-MSC
                    members pay $325/quarter; MSC members pay $160/quarter.

                <p style="display: none; font-weight: normal;">
                    Normally, practices are scheduled for Monday-Friday mornings, regardless
                    of whether or not it's a holiday (and, except in the summer, one Saturday
                    morning each month). Check with the coach, or Tom Grandine or Mike Schaeffer
                    at practice as each holiday draws near in case there are any exceptions;
                    or check the workout/coaching schedule <a href="/calendar/" rel="calendar" class="navItem">here</a>.
